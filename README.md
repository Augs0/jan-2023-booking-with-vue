# Learning Vue #1 - Booking System

For this project, I wanted to put the parts of Vue.js I had started to learn into practice by trying to build a full stack project. I created a booking system for a made up tour company with a PSQL backend and Vue.js front end.

## Features
- You are able to book onto a tour
- You are advised if your tour booking was successful or unsuccessful
- You cannot book onto a full tour
- You can read about the tours and see how many spots are left
- You can read about each guide individually
- You can use both a light and dark mode
- You can use this on mobile

## How to use this repo
